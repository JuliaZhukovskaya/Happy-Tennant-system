Happy Tennant is a system for tennants, managers and workers to manage applications of some issues in the building 
(f.e the water is running in the sink, the elevator doesn't work). 
Tennats can leave their application and see all the updates (statuses) of it. Managers can assign all the applications in the system and assign one to any worker
and change status of this application. Workers can see the applications that were assigned to them and change their status.
